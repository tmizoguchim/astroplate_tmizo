    bulletpoints:
      -  "If we can realize material design by understanding the correlation between the atomic and electronic structure of materials and the expression of their functions, we can dramatically accelerate the development of materials. In order to realize such material design, it is necessary to understand the atomic and electronic structures of the local regions that are responsible for materials functions, and to elucidate the mechanisms and physics for arising the materials functions."
      - "The Nano Materials Design Laboratory (NMDL) at the Institute of Industrial Science, The University of Tokyo, aims to precisely analyze the structure-function relationship of materials (structure-function relationship) using computer simulation, information science, and atomic-level measurement, and to realize materials design based on this analysis."

      - "Since our group is part of an affiliated research institute, it is not directly associated with any undergraduate school. It is composed of graduate students, researchers, and staff who belong to the Department of Materials Science and Engineering at the Graduate School of Engineering, The University of Tokyo."

      - ""The students in our group have transferred universities and laboratories upon advancing to graduate school. While transferring to a new group and new university is very challenging, there are many*10 more things to gain from its experience."
      - "The students joined to our group start new research themes after entering graduate school, and even within a limited time, they present at academic conferences, and become the first authors of academic manuscript that leave a mark in the history of Science. You can see our achievements, including conference presentations and awards, from the Achievements section above menu."
